Calculating random number through system time

1.Taking range from user.
2.System time taken in milliseconds and taking last 2 digits of time(in milliseconds).
3.If last digit is less than 73 then we can give the value greater than the mid range so that it would be 73% biased situation for higher number.
4.Else It would be less than the midrange and would be 27% biased to Lower number.
5.Hence will generate random number accordingly.
